In February 2023, the grad school admissions search website TheGradCafe suffered a data breach
that disclosed the personal records of 310k users. The data included email addresses, names and
usernames, genders, geographic locations and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. Some records
also included physical address, phone number and date of birth. TheGradCafe did not respond
to multiple attempts to disclose the breach.
