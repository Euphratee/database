There's a method out right now that allows bad actors to refund items from certain online stores without
actually giving up the purchased items. This refunding method has become pretty popular in the past 3 years
and it seems like law enforcement is finally catching on. Today we'll be discussing refunding in detail
and talk about 2 refunding kingpins. Each is associated with their own million-dollar fraud empire, RessuRefunds,
and SimpleRefunds. Unfortunately, they were both arrested this late September and are now on trial for
both Wire Fraud and Mail Fraud.
