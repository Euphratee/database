In approximately August 2022, the Alt-Right Video sharing platform BrandNewTube suffered
a data breach that impacted 347k members. The breach included Email addresses, Private messages,
Videos posted, Comments, IP Addresses, Genders, Usernames and Passwords stored as SHA-1 hashes.
Due to BrandNewTube using an outdated hashing method, it allowed many passwords to be rapidly cracked.
The breach occurred because of a 2 year old vulnerability, which was the same way it was hacked back in 2020.
