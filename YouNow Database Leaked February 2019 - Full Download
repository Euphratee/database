In February 2019, data from the live broadcasting service YouNow appeared for sale on a dark web marketplace.
Whilst it's not clear what date the actual breach occurred on, the impacted data included 18M unique email
addresses, IP addresses, names, usernames and links to social media profiles. As authentication is performed
via social providers, no passwords were exposed in the breach. Many records didn't have associated email
addresses thus the unique number is lower than the reported total number of accounts.

Compromised data: Email addresses, IP addresses, Names, Social media profiles, Usernames
