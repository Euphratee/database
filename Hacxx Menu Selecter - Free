Solve the program of people nowadays that use phone all the time.
Simple option to show menus to end-client.

1 - Upload a image from your restaurant menu
2 - Click upload
3 - Scan the QR code on your phone as test
4 - Save the generated QR Code image
5 - Print a few QR Code
6 - Plug it to the tables

Note: Suggest customers to install a QR Code reader from Google Play on the Android or iPhone and let them
browse all the options available in the restaurant without requiring a internet connection and very easy 
to create.

Note 2: This tool is broken as the api doesn't accept long images in base64. Will try to fix this by using
a diferent api to generate the QR code.
