The Marriott data breach 2018 was a cyberattack that exposed the personal information of up to 500 million guests who made reservations at Starwood properties from 2014 to 2018. The hackers accessed names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passport numbers, loyalty program account information, reservation information, and payment card numbers and expiration dates1.

Marriott said the payment card numbers were encrypted, but it did not know if the hackers also stole the information needed to decrypt them1. The breach was detected in September 2018, after Marriott had acquired Starwood, by an internal security tool that flagged a suspicious attempt to access the guest reservation database.

The breach was blamed on the Chinese government by some American officials and analysts4. Marriott faced investigations and fines by regulators for failing to protect the personal data on its systems, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
