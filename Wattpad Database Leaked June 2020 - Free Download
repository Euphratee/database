In June 2020, the user-generated stories website Wattpad suffered a huge data breach
that exposed almost 270 million records. The data was initially sold then published
on a public hacking forum where it was broadly shared. The incident exposed extensive
personal information including names and usernames, email and IP addresses, genders,
birth dates and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes.

I would like to warn users this leak is over 119.41GB uncompressed and 22.05GB compressed.

Compromised data: Bios, Dates of birth, Email addresses, Genders, Geographic locations, IP addresses, Names, Passwords, Social media profiles, User website URLs, Usernames
