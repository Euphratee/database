In January 2022, a vulnerability in Twitter's platform allowed an attacker to build a database
of the email addresses and phone numbers of millions of users of the social platform. In a disclosure
notice later shared in August 2022, Twitter advised that the vulnerability was related to a bug 
introduced in June 2021 and that they are directly notifying impacted customers. The impacted 
data included either email address or phone number alongside other public information including
the username, display name, bio, location and profile photo. The data included 6.7M unique
email addresses across both active and suspended accounts, the latter appearing in a separate list of 1.4M addresses.
