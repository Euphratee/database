In March 2021, the world's largest eyewear company Luxoticca suffered a data breach via one
of their partners that exposed the personal information of more than 70M people. The data was
subsequently sold via a popular hacking forum in late 2022 and included email and physical
addresses, names, genders, dates of birth and phone numbers. In a statement from Luxottica,
they advised they were aware of the incident and are currently "considering other notification
obligations".
