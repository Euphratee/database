In May 2022, the survey website QuestionPro was the target of an extortion attempt
relating to an alleged data breach. Over 100GB of data containing 22M unique email 
addresses (some of which appear to be generated by the platform), are alleged to have 
been extracted from the service along with IP addresses, browser user agents and results
relating to surveys. QuestionPro would not confirm whether a breach had occurred
(although they did confirm they were the target of an extortion attempt).
