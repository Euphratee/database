A password solver tool is a type of software designed to assist in recovering or cracking passwords. These tools are often
used in cybersecurity and can employ various techniques to guess or crack passwords, such as brute-force attacks,
dictionary attacks, or rainbow table attacks.

While password solver tools can have legitimate purposes, such as helping users recover their forgotten passwords or
assisting security professionals in testing the strength of password systems, they can also be misused for unauthorized
access to protected systems or accounts.

It's important to note that the usage of password solver tools should be within legal and ethical boundaries. Engaging in
any form of unauthorized access or using these tools for malicious purposes is illegal and can have severe consequences.
