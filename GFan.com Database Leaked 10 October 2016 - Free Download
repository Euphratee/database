In October 2016, data surfaced that was allegedly obtained from the Chinese website known as GFAN and contained 22.5M accounts.
Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has
been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email and IP addresses, user names and salted and hashed passwords.

Breach date: 10 October 2016

Compromised accounts: 22,526,334

Compromised data: Email addresses, IP addresses, Passwords, Usernames
