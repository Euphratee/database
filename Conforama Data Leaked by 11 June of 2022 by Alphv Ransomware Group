I was researching information when i found the news article below about Conforama breach. The
ransomware group Alphv published in there darknet page that they had more than 1TB of data
from Conforama computers and was demanding a ransom or they will publish all they had online. 
I dig on Alphv page and was able to find the anouncement of this attack and decide to dig all
the darknet site and didn't found the full leak. This means or they paid the ransom or it was 
all a bluff, either way, here is the data that they use to announce the breach.
