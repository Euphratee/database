Caesars Entertainment, self-described as the largest U.S. casino chain with the most extensive loyalty program in the industry, says it paid a ransom to avoid the online leak of customer data stolen in a recent cyberattack.

Caesars discovered on September 7th that the attackers stole its loyalty program database, which stores driver’s license numbers and social security numbers for many customers.

“We are still investigating the extent of any additional personal or otherwise sensitive information contained in the files acquired by the unauthorized actor,” says an 8-K form filed by Caesars with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.
