In 2016, a list of over 33 million individuals in corporate America sourced from Dun & Bradstreet'
NetProspex service was leaked online. D&B believe the targeted marketing data was lost by a customer
who purchased it from them. It contained extensive personal and corporate information including names,
email addresses, job titles and general information about the employer.
