Recently, Tele2 Russia, a major mobile operator in the country, experienced a data leak that exposed
sensitive customer information. The leaked data contained personal details of over 1.2 million customers,
including their full names, phone numbers, home addresses, and passport details. The incident has raised
concerns about the security of customer data and the measures taken by Tele2 to safeguard it.

According to reports, the data was leaked from an unsecured database that was accessible via the internet.
The database contained records of customers who had signed up for the Tele2 mobile services between 2017
and 2020. The breach was discovered by a security researcher who came across the database and reported
it to Tele2.

In response to the incident, Tele2 issued a statement acknowledging the breach and stating that they had
taken immediate steps to secure the database and launch an investigation. The company also stated that it
had notified the relevant authorities and was working closely with them to resolve the issue.
