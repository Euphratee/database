In May 2016, a set of breached data originating from the virtual pet website "Neopets" was found being
traded online. Allegedly hacked "several years earlier", the data contains sensitive personal information
including birthdates, genders and names as well as almost 27 million unique email addresses. Passwords were
stored in plain text and IP addresses were also present in the breach.

Compromised data: Dates of birth, Email addresses, Genders, Geographic locations, IP addresses, Names,
Passwords, Usernames
