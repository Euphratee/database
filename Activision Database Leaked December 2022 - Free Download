In December 2022, attackers socially engineered an Activision HR employee into disclosing information
which led to the breach of almost 20k employee records. The data contained 16k unique email addresses
along with names, phone numbers, job titles and the office location of the employee. Activision advised
that no sensitive employee information was included in the breach.
