In September 2019, it was reported that a database containing the personal information of over
218 million users of Zynga, the popular mobile game developer, had been leaked. The leak was
discovered by a security researcher who goes by the name Gnosticplayers, and it was found to
include data such as users' names, email addresses, login IDs, and passwords.

The data breach is believed to have occurred in September 2019, but it was not publicly disclosed
by Zynga until December of that year. At the time, the company stated that it had already taken
steps to protect the data of its users, including resetting passwords and notifying potentially
affected individuals.

While Zynga assured its users that no financial information had been compromised in the breach,
the fact that so much personal data had been exposed was still cause for concern. Hackers who
obtain login information can potentially use it to gain access to other accounts that use the
same password, putting users' financial and personal information at risk.
