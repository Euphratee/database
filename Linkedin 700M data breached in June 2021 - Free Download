There were reports in June 2021 of a data breach that affected LinkedIn, potentially exposing the personal
information of up to 700 million users. The data that was allegedly stolen included users' email addresses,
full names, phone numbers, physical addresses, and more.

It's worth noting that this breach did not involve a hack of LinkedIn's systems, but rather the scraping of
public profiles by cybercriminals. Nonetheless, it still represents a serious privacy concern for LinkedIn
users, as the information that was stolen could be used to conduct phishing attacks, identity theft,
and other types of fraud.

LinkedIn has stated that it is taking steps to mitigate the impact of the breach, including invalidating
any passwords that may have been compromised and alerting affected users to the potential risks. It's
always a good idea for users to take steps to protect their personal information online, such as using strong,
unique passwords for each account and regularly monitoring their financial statements for signs of
unauthorized activity.
