In late 2016, a huge list of email address and password pairs appeared in a "combo list"
referred to as "Exploit.In". The list contained 593 million unique email addresses,
many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was
broadly circulated and used for "credential stuffing", that is attackers employ it in an
attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password.

I would like to warn users this leak is over 24.28GB uncompressed and 8.46GB compressed.
