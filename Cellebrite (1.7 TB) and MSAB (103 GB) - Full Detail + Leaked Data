Cellebrite and MSAB are two of the most well-known digital forensics companies in the world. Both companies
specialize in developing software and hardware solutions for extracting and analyzing digital data from
mobile devices and computers. While their products are used primarily by law enforcement agencies, they
are also used by corporations and private individuals for various purposes.

Cellebrite

Cellebrite was founded in 1999 in Israel, and today it has offices in the United States, Germany, and Singapore.
The company offers a range of digital forensics products, including software for data extraction, analysis, and
reporting, as well as hardware solutions for on-site data acquisition. Cellebrite's products are used by law
enforcement agencies in over 100 countries, and the company claims to have helped solve thousands of cases,
including those involving terrorism, child exploitation, and financial crimes.

One of the most controversial products developed by Cellebrite is its UFED (Universal Forensic Extraction Device),
which is a portable device that allows law enforcement agencies to extract data from a wide range of mobile devices,
including smartphones and tablets. The device can extract data such as call logs, contacts, messages, and files,
as well as perform advanced analysis on the data, such as keyword searching and link analysis.

Cellebrite has faced criticism from civil rights organizations and privacy advocates for its involvement
in some high-profile cases, such as the San Bernardino iPhone case. In this case, the FBI was trying to
gain access to the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, and Cellebrite was reportedly hired to
help. While Cellebrite has not confirmed its involvement in the case, reports suggest that the company
was able to successfully extract data from the iPhone.

MSAB

MSAB was founded in Sweden in 1984 and today has offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Singapore.
The company specializes in developing digital forensics software solutions for law enforcement agencies, as well
as corporations and private individuals. MSAB's flagship product is XRY, which is a software solution for extracting
and analyzing data from mobile devices and computers.

XRY is used by law enforcement agencies around the world and is capable of extracting data from a wide range of
mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and GPS devices. The software can extract data such as call logs,
contacts, messages, and files, as well as perform advanced analysis on the data, such as keyword searching and link analysis.

MSAB has also faced criticism from civil rights organizations and privacy advocates for its involvement in some
high-profile cases. For example, in 2014, the company was criticized for its involvement in the investigation into
the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. 
According to reports, MSAB provided the Ferguson Police Department with XRY software, which was used to extract
data from the mobile devices of Brown and other individuals involved in the case.

Conclusion

Cellebrite and MSAB are two of the most well-known digital forensics companies in the world, and their products are
used by law enforcement agencies, corporations, and private individuals for various purposes. While their products are
capable of extracting and analyzing vast amounts of digital data, the companies have faced criticism from civil rights
organizations and privacy advocates for their involvement in some high-profile cases. As technology continues to evolve,
the use of digital forensics products is likely to become even more widespread, and it will be interesting to see how
Cellebrite, MSAB, and other companies in the field adapt to these changes.
