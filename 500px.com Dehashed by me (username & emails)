In mid-2018, the online photography community 500px suffered a data breach. The incident 
exposed almost 15 million unique email addresses alongside names, usernames, genders, 
dates of birth and either an MD5 or bcrypt password hash. In 2019, the data appeared
listed for sale on a dark web marketplace (along with several other large breaches)
and subsequently began circulating more broadly.
