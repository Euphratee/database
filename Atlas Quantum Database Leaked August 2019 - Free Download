In late 2019, news broke that the cryptocurrency exchange, Atlas Quantum, had suffered a data
breach resulting in the leak of sensitive customer information. This breach, which occurred in
August of that year, exposed the personal data of approximately 264,000 customers of the exchange.

The leaked information included customer names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and
account balances. In addition to this, the hackers were able to gain access to the exchange's
entire transaction history, including wallet addresses and transaction amounts.

The breach was initially discovered by a group of researchers from the security firm, CipherBlade,
who were investigating a series of thefts from Atlas Quantum's wallets. They discovered that the
attackers had gained access to the exchange's servers through a vulnerability in a third-party
server that was used by Atlas Quantum.

Despite the severity of the breach, Atlas Quantum initially denied that any customer data had been stolen.
However, it soon became clear that the breach was far more serious than the company had initially
acknowledged. In a statement released in September 2019, Atlas Quantum admitted that customer
data had indeed been compromised.
