In November 2022, the Turkish Citizens Health Database "Halk Sağlığı Yönetim Sistemi" (HSYS) (hsys.saglik.gov.tr)
suffered a data breach that impacted 100 over million citizens. The attack led to the exposure of data including
Full names, Dates of birth, General location (City & District), Parents names and Parents ID Numbers.

This thread includes the raw database files and a .sql dump of the data for easy viewing.

I would like to warn users this leak is over 23.54GB uncompressed and 8.92GB compressed.

Compromised data: Citizen ID Numbers, Full names, Dates of birth, General location (City & District),
Parents names, Parents ID Numbers
