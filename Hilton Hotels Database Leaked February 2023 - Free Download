In February 2023, Hilton Hotels, one of the largest hotel chains in the world, suffered a major data
breach resulting in the leak of sensitive customer information. The breach was first reported by a
group of hackers who claimed to have accessed the hotel's database and stolen customer data. The hotel
chain later confirmed the breach and launched an investigation into the incident.

The data breach is believed to have affected millions of customers worldwide who had stayed at any of
the Hilton hotels between 2015 and 2022. The leaked information includes customers' names, contact information,
payment card details, and booking history. This is a serious violation of privacy and could potentially 
lead to financial fraud and identity theft.
