Duowan.com, a popular Chinese gaming website, has suffered a data breach resulting in the
leaking of its database. The leaked data reportedly includes sensitive information of millions
of users, including email addresses, usernames, and passwords.

Duowan.com, which is owned by Tencent Holdings Limited, is one of the largest gaming websites
in China. It has a massive user base, with millions of users accessing the site daily to play
games, connect with other gamers, and participate in various gaming communities. However, the
recent data breach has put the privacy and security of these users at risk.

According to reports, the database was first discovered by a cybersecurity researcher who found
it being sold on an underground forum. The researcher then notified the website, which later
confirmed that its database had been breached. The company stated that the breach was caused
by a third-party service provider that was managing the website's data.

The leaked data reportedly contains information about users who registered with the website between
2008 and 2010. It includes email addresses, usernames, and passwords in plaintext. The passwords
were not hashed, which means they were stored in a readable format, making it easy for hackers to access them.
