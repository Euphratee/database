Why will not use free anonfiles or mega.nz or Mediafire?
Content filters, if the files are in one of the popular file hosting sites the admin can delete
the same file in multiple accounts with just one search away with there internal file tool.

Why pay?
If you work with databases, most likely you have e-money. By purchasing premium is a incentive
for file hosting sites to keep the files.

MY GOAL?
Build the largest decentralized hacker community network.

Anonfiles.com has closed.
-------------------------
A lot of users were saying to me all the time on diferent forums, why i only post on paid
file hosting sites and not give them for free on anonfiles or mega.nz. This is the reason.
