In July 2015, the Qatar National Bank suffered a data breach which exposed 15k
documents totalling 1.4GB and detailing more than 100k accounts with passwords and PINs.
The incident was made public some 9 months later in April 2016 when the documents appeared
publicly on a file sharing site. Analysis of the breached data suggests the attack began
by exploiting a SQL injection flaw in the bank's website.

Compromised data: Bank account numbers, Customer feedback, Dates of birth, Financial transactions,
Genders, Geographic locations, Government issued IDs, IP addresses, Marital statuses, Names,
Passwords, Phone numbers, Physical addresses, PINs, Security questions and answers, Spoken languages
