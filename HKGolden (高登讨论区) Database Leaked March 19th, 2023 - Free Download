Recently, news broke that the Hong Kong online forum, HKGolden (高登讨论区), had suffered a data breach,
resulting in the leak of its user database. HKGolden is a popular discussion forum that covers a wide
range of topics, including politics, current events, entertainment, and technology. The forum has been
around since 2001 and has a significant following, particularly among Hong Kong's younger generations.

The breach was first reported on March 19th, 2023, when a hacker group known as "D34th5h3ll" announced
that they had accessed HKGolden's user database and posted it online. The group claims to have obtained
the data through a vulnerability in the forum's security system. The database contained sensitive information
such as usernames, email addresses, and encrypted passwords of over one million HKGolden users.
