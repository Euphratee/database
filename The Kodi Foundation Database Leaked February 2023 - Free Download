In February 2023, The Kodi Foundation suffered a data breach that exposed more than 400k user records.
Attributed to an account belonging to "a trusted but currently inactive member of the forum admin team",
the breach involved the administrator account creating a database backup that was subsequently downloaded
before being sold on a hacking forum. The breach exposed email and IP addresses, usernames, genders
and passwords stored as MyBB salted hashes.
