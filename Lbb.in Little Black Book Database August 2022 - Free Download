In August 2022, customer data of the Indian shopping site "LBB" (Little Black Book) was posted
to a popular hacking forum. The data contained over 3M records with 39k unique email addresses 
alongside IP and physical addresses, names and device information with the most recent data 
dating back to early 2019. LBB advised they believe the data was exposed by a third party service 
and whilst it contained information they retain on their customers, it had also been enriched 
with additional data attributes.

Website: lbb.in, littleblackbook.com
