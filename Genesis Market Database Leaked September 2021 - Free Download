In September 2021, news broke that the infamous dark web marketplace Genesis Market had suffered
a massive data breach. The database of the site, which reportedly contained user information and
transaction details, was leaked online, potentially compromising the privacy and security of
thousands of users.

Genesis Market was one of the largest and most popular dark web marketplaces, known for its wide
range of illegal products and services. The site had been operating since 2019, and it quickly
gained a reputation as a reliable and secure platform for underground transactions.

However, on September 13th, 2021, a user on the popular hacking forum claimed to have obtained
the entire database of Genesis Market, which included usernames, hashed passwords, and other
sensitive information. The hacker posted a sample of the data to prove their claim, and soon after,
the full database was made available for download on various file-sharing sites.

The leak of the Genesis Market database was a significant blow to the site and its users. For one,
it exposed the identities and personal information of many individuals who had used the platform to
purchase illegal products and services.
