In July 2015, the online trading platform SvenskaMagic suffered a major data breach, resulting in the 
leakage of sensitive information from the website's database. The incident not only compromised the 
security of user accounts but also exposed the platform's trade secrets.

SvenskaMagic is an online trading platform for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) players based in Sweden.
The platform allows players to buy, sell and trade MTG cards, create and join communities and tournaments,
and access a database of MTG cards and sets.

The data breach occurred on July 17, 2015, when an anonymous hacker leaked the entire database of
SvenskaMagic on a hacking forum. The database contained user information such as email addresses,
usernames, hashed passwords, and trade history. It also contained the platform's source code, which
includes the platform's codebase, the API keys, and the database credentials in MD5 or an Unknown format.
