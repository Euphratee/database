In April 2021, a large data set of over 500 million Facebook users was made freely available for download.
Encompassing approximately 20% of Facebook's subscribers, the data was allegedly obtained by exploiting a
vulnerability Facebook advises they rectified in August 2019. The primary value of the data is the association
of phone numbers to identities; whilst each record included phone, only 2.5 million contained an email address.
Most records contained names and genders with many also including dates of birth, location, relationship status
and employer.

I would like to warn users this leak is over 77.3GB uncompressed and 12.17GB compressed.

Compromised data: Dates of birth, Email addresses, Employers, Genders, Geographic locations,
Names, Phone numbers, Relationship statuses
