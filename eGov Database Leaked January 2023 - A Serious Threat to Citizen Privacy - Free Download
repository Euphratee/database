On January 2023, a massive data breach was reported in the eGov database, one of the largest databases
of citizensâ€™ personal information in the country. The data leak is considered to be one of the largest
in the country's history, compromising the sensitive information of millions of citizens.

The leaked data contains personal information such as full names, addresses, date of birth, social
security numbers, and financial information, making it a goldmine for identity theft and fraud.
The breach was discovered by security researchers, who reported the incident to the authorities immediately.

The eGov database is used by various government agencies to store citizens' information and is responsible
for managing the country's electronic identity system. The government has assured citizens that all
necessary measures are being taken to secure the database and prevent similar breaches in the future.
