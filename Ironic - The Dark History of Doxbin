Doxbin needs no introduction as one of the most toxic places on the internet. However the history of the site
is still widely unknown since it dates all the way back to 2011. It was originally founded by an anonymous
808chan user who gave the site to a friend who found someone else to run it. This anonymous someone took up
the name Nachash and led Doxbin for 3 years until the FBI took it all down in 2014 along with other Darknet sites
like the Silk Road and Hydra Marketplace. The story goes deeper but you'll have to watch the entire video.
