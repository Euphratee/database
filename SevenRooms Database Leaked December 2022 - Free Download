In December 2022, over 400GB of data belonging to restaurant customer management platform SevenRooms was posted for sale 
to a popular hacking forum. The data included 1.2M unique email addresses alongside names and purchases. SevenRooms 
advised that the breach was due to unauthorised access of "a file transfer interface of a third-party vendor".
