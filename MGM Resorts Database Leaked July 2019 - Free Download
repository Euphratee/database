In July 2019, MGM Resorts discovered a data breach of one of their cloud services.
The breach included 10.6M guest records with 3.1M unique email addresses stemming back
to 2017. The exposed data included email and physical addresses, names, phone numbers
and dates of birth and was subsequently shared on a popular hacking forum in February
2020 where it was extensively redistributed.
