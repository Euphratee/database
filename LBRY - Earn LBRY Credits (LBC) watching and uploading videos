LBRY is a blockchain-based file-sharing and payment network that powers decentralized platforms,
primarily social networks and video platforms. Video-sharing websites such as LBRY.tv and Odysee
are decentralized alternatives to YouTube. Essentially LBRY Credits (LBC) is a payment coin for
users to upload videos to the network. The LBRY network is similar to torrents network. The videos
are never stored in a server and is distributed across the network which makes it harder to 
delete and easier for viewers to earn LBRY Credits (LBC).
