The University of Minnesota confirms that it has contacted law enforcement and is investigating a claimed
data breach that officials became aware of just a month ago.

University of Minnesota spokesman Jake Ricker released a statement to KARE 11 saying on July 21 school
administrators became aware that an “unauthorized party” claimed to possess sensitive data reportedl
y taken from the institution’s computer systems. Ricker says an investigation was launched as soon as
the claim was discovered, local law enforcement was contacted and state and federal regulators were
also notified.
