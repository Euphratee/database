In February 2018, a massive collection of almost 3,000 alleged data breaches was found online. Whilst some of
the data had previously been seen online, 2,844 of the files consisting of more than 80 million unique email
addresses had not previously been seen. Each file contained both an email address and plain text password
and consequently loaded as a single data breach.

Compromised data: Email addresses, Passwords
