In May 2018, the website for the ticket distribution service Ticketfly was defaced by an attacker and was subsequently taken offline.
The attacker allegedly requested a ransom to share details of the vulnerability with Ticketfly but did not receive a reply and
subsequently posted the breached data online to a publicly accessible location. The data included over 26 million unique email
addresses along with names, physical addresses and phone numbers. Whilst there were no passwords in the publicly leaked data,
Ticketfly later issued an incident update and stated that "It is possible, however, that hashed values of password credentials
could have been accessed".

Note: This is a partial, only 6 Million emails.
