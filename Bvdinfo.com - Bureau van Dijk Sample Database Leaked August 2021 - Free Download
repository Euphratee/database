In approximately August 2021, hundreds of gigabytes of data produced by Bureau van Dijk (BVD) was obtained and later published to a popular hacking forum. BVD claims to "capture and treat private company information for better decision making and increased efficiency", and the corpus of data released contained hundreds of millions of lines about corporations and individuals, including personal information such as names and dates of birth. The data also included 28M unique email addresses along with physical addresses (presumedly corporate locations), phone numbers and job titles.
