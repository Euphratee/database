In May 2021, news broke out that Web Hosting Talk (WHT), one of the largest online communities for web hosting
professionals, suffered a data breach. The incident resulted in the exposure of user information, including usernames,
email addresses, and hashed passwords. The hackers also reportedly accessed the forum's private messages and
other sensitive data.

The WHT data breach occurred on May 4, 2021, and the forum's administrators discovered the incident a day later.
The administrators immediately took the site offline and notified its members of the breach. The notification
email advised users to change their passwords on WHT and any other online accounts where they used the same password.
