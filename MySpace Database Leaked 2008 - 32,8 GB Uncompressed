In approximately 2008, MySpace suffered a data breach that exposed almost 360 million accounts. In May 2016 the data was offered 
up for sale on the "Real Deal" dark market website and included email addresses, usernames and SHA1 hashes of the first 10 
characters of the password converted to lowercase and stored without a salt. The exact breach date is unknown, but analysis
of the data suggests it was 8 years before being made public.

Compromised data: Email addresses, Passwords, Usernames
