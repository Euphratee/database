In May 2014, the link management company Bitly announced they'd suffered a data breach. 
The breach contains over 9.3 million unique email addresses, usernames and hashed passwords,
most using SHA1 with a small number using bcrypt.

Warning: Bitly uses Two Factor Authentication on the user login, this means if
you try to bruteforce any username/email and password it will automatically send a sms
to the account owner.
