In early 2021, EpicNPC, a popular online forum for buying, selling, and trading virtual goods, experienced
a major data breach. The breach resulted in the exposure of personal information belonging to thousands of
users, including email addresses, usernames, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.

The EpicNPC leak was first reported on March 10, 2021, by cybersecurity firm Under the Breach. According to
their report, a hacker had obtained a copy of the EpicNPC database and was offering it for sale on a hacking
forum. The database contained information on over 500,000 users, including their email addresses and passwords.
