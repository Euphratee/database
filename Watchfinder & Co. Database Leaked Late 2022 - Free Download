Watchfinder & Co. is a luxury watch retailer that has made a name for itself in the industry. It is 
known for offering a wide range of high-end timepieces, from well-known brands such as Rolex, Cartier,
and Omega, to more niche brands such as Bremont and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Recently, it has come to light
that the company's customer database has been leaked, causing concern for those who have made purchases
from the company.

The leak is believed to have occurred in late 2022, but the company only became aware of it in early 2023.
The database reportedly contained information on Watchfinder & Co. customers, including their names,
addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and purchase histories. It is unclear how many customers
were affected by the leak, but it is believed to be in the thousands.
