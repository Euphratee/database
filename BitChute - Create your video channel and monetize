BitChute is a decentralized video hosting platform that allows users to upload, share,
and view videos. It was created in 2017 as an alternative to mainstream platforms like
YouTube. BitChute differentiates itself by promoting freedom of speech and resisting
censorship, which has made it popular among individuals and groups who feel their
content may be restricted or removed on other platforms.
