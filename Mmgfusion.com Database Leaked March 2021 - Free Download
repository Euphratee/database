In March 2021, a cybersecurity breach occurred at mmgfusion.com, a digital marketing and SEO company.
The breach resulted in the exposure of sensitive data belonging to thousands of clients of the company. 
The incident was a wake-up call to businesses to take cybersecurity seriously and invest in robust security
measures to protect their data.

According to reports, the breach was the result of a vulnerability in an unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS)
bucket, which allowed cybercriminals to gain access to the company's database. The exposed data included names,
email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information belonging to clients of mmgfusion.com.

The leak was discovered by a security researcher who stumbled upon the unsecured AWS bucket while scanning
the internet for misconfigured cloud storage. The researcher reported the vulnerability to mmgfusion.com,
but the company failed to respond to the report, leaving the data exposed for several weeks.
