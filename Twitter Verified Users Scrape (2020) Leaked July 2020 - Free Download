In July 2020, news broke that a group of individuals had scraped data from Twitter's verified user accounts. The incident
raised concerns about the security of Twitter's platform and the privacy of its users.

Twitter's verified accounts are accounts that have been authenticated by Twitter as being legitimate accounts of 
public figures or organizations. These accounts are identified by a blue checkmark next to the user's name, and 
they are meant to help users differentiate between real accounts and fake accounts.

The individuals who scraped the data from Twitter's verified accounts used a technique called web scraping, which
involves using automated software to collect data from websites. In this case, the individuals used a tool called 
"DataSpii" to scrape data from the profiles of Twitter's verified users.

The data that was scraped included personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, and location data.
This information was then sold on a website called "People Data Labs" which specializes in selling personal information.
