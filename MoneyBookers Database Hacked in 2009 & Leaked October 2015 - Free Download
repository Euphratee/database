Sometime in 2009, the e-wallet service known as Money Bookers suffered a data breach
which exposed almost 4.5M customers. Now called Skrill, the breach was not discovered
until October 2015 and included names, email addresses, home addresses and IP addresses.

Note: One of my first emails is in this database and after verification it is a match.
It includes First and Last name, Mobile number, Address, Postal Code, Language, Date of Birth and IP.
