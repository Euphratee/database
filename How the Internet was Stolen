I look at the history of the internet, from ARPANET & NSFNET, through privatization, to Tim-Berners Lee, Yahoo, Netscape,
Google, eBay, and Facebook, examining Microsoft's antitrust court case and their battle against Open Source and Free
Software, Bill Gate's Open Letter to Hobbyists and the leaked Halloween Documents. Then we take a look at the emergence
of Surveillance Capitalism, and how platforms like AirBnb & Uber coopt the idea of the community and lobby politicians.
Finally, we take a look at some alternatives.
