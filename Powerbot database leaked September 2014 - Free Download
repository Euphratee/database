In September 2014, a database belonging to Powerbot, a company that provides a chatbot service, was leaked.
The database contained sensitive information such as names, addresses, email addresses, and chat transcripts 
of over 5 million users.

The leak was discovered by a security researcher, who alerted Powerbot to the issue. The company quickly took
steps to secure the database and investigate the cause of the leak. It was later discovered that the leak was
the result of a misconfigured database that was left open to the internet.

The data contained email and IP addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes of passwords.
