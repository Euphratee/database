On July 23, 2018, the Apollo database was leaked, causing concern and outrage among users and experts in the tech industry. 
The Apollo database was a collection of user information from the popular Chinese social media platform, including sensitive
personal data such as real names, addresses, and phone numbers.

The leak occurred when an unauthorized party gained access to the database and downloaded the entire contents, which included
the personal information of millions of users. The data was then posted online, making it easily accessible to anyone with
an internet connection.

The consequences of the leak were significant, as many users were worried about the potential for identity theft and other
forms of cybercrime. In addition, the leak raised concerns about the security practices of the company responsible for the
database, and led to calls for greater protections for personal data.

In the aftermath of the leak, the Chinese government launched an investigation into the matter, and the company behind the
Apollo database took steps to improve its security measures. Despite these efforts, however, the damage had already been done,
and many users remained concerned about the safety of their personal information.

Overall, the Apollo database leak serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of securing personal data and the potential
consequences of a breach. It is a reminder that even the most seemingly secure systems can be vulnerable to attacks, and that
it is crucial to take steps to protect ourselves and our information online.
