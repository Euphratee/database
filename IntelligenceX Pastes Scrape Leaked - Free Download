Recently, it has been reported that a significant amount of sensitive data has been leaked online. The data
was obtained through a technique called "pasting," which involves scraping information from websites that
allow users to post text anonymously. This method has been used by a company called IntelligenceX, which
specializes in data collection and analysis.

The leaked data is said to include a vast array of personal information, such as email addresses, passwords,
and social security numbers. It is believed that the data was obtained from a variety of sources, including 
social media sites, online forums, and other websites that allow users to post content anonymously.

The use of pasting as a data collection method is not new, and it has been employed by researchers, journalists, 
and security experts for years. However, the recent leak highlights the potential dangers of this technique, 
particularly when used by companies that are not transparent about their data collection practices.
