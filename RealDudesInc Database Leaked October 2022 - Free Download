In October 2022, the Grand Theft Auto Reseller RealDudesInc suffered a data breach. The leak led
to the exposure of data including Email addresses, Usernames and Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes.
In total, 101k users were affected.

It appears there are roughly 30â€“40k customers who have not checked out as guests. The remaining
accounts are guest accounts with either the word guest or random characters in their email or username.

Compromised data: Email addresses, Usernames, Passwords
