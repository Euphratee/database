On July 4th, 2018, it was reported that the database of fashion retailer Romwe had been leaked. The leak, which
was discovered by security researchers at vpnMentor, exposed the personal and financial information of millions
of Romwe customers.

The leaked database contained a wide range of sensitive information, including names, addresses, email addresses,
phone numbers, and payment details. In addition to this, the database also contained information about the orders
placed by customers, including the items purchased and the price paid.

The leak was the result of a misconfigured database that was left publicly accessible on the internet. This allowed
anyone with the correct URL to access the database and view the sensitive information it contained.

The news of the Romwe data leak quickly spread, and the company was heavily criticized for its failure to secure
its customers' personal and financial information. Many customers expressed outrage at the company's lack of
security, and some even called for a boycott of Romwe products.
