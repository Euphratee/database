What is SEC Email & Notifications Spammer?
SEC Email & Notifications Spammer is a tool that takes advantage of a vulnerability in SEC site that
can be used to send spam using official SEC servers. This tool is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) and because
SEC is big i highly doubt that they will answer or even be slightly interested in solving this bug.

How to use?
To send spam emails the user just need to write the email and hit on Send! Automatically this tool
will start sending spam to the destination email. Also it doesn't show any message. Leave it running
for 1 or 2 minutes and close. (1 or 2 minutes is enough to send 500 spam emails).

Note: Remember to close the app after hitting Send! or it will continue send emails until the browser
crash or the system run out of resources. This tool has a 100% inbox delivery on all major emails
(Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOL, etc). Can also be used to spam notifications on mobile devices.

Price: $50, pm me for more details.
