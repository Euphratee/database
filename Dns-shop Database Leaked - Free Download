Recently, it has been reported that the DNS-shop, a major Russian online retailer, has suffered a
data breach resulting in the leak of its entire customer database. The incident has been a cause
for concern among the customers and has raised questions about the company's security protocols.

According to reports, the leaked database contains personal information of over 1.4 million customers,
including their full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and encrypted passwords. The data dump
was made available on various underground hacking forums, and it is believed that cybercriminals
have already begun using this information to carry out targeted attacks on the customers.

The DNS-shop has confirmed the breach and stated that it was caused by a third-party contractor
who had access to their database. The company has also assured its customers that no payment information
or credit card details were compromised in the breach.
