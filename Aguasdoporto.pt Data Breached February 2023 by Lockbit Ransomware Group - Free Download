In February 2023, a major data breach was discovered at aguasdoporto.pt, a Portuguese municipal
water utility company that manages full water cycle including water supply, wastewater drainage.
The breach was caused by a ransomware attack carried out by the LockBit group, a notorious cybercriminal
organization known for its expertise in carrying out such attacks.

According to reports, the attack on aguasdoporto.pt was sophisticated and well-coordinated. The LockBit
group managed to gain access to the company's systems and encrypt its files, effectively locking the company
out of its own data. The attackers then demanded a ransom of millions of euros in exchange for the decryption
key that would unlock the files.

In response to the attack, aguasdoporto.pt immediately contacted law enforcement and cybersecurity experts.
They also issued a public statement acknowledging the breach and warning customers to be vigilant about any
suspicious activity related to their personal information. The company assured customers that it was working
to mitigate the damage caused by the breach and restore its systems.
