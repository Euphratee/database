Recently, news of a significant data breach at Bourse des Vols, a French online travel agency, has been
circulating. The company has confirmed that its database has been leaked, and this incident is a cause
for concern for its customers.

According to reports, the leaked database contained personal and sensitive information of over 700,000
customers, including their names, email addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Additionally,
it was found that the database also contained payment details such as credit card numbers and CVV codes, 
which could potentially be used for fraudulent activities.

The breach was discovered by a cybersecurity researcher who came across the database on a well-known
hacking forum. The data was being offered for sale for $4,000, and it is believed that the breach occurred 
in December 2021. Bourse des Vols confirmed the breach and stated that it had taken immediate measures
to secure its database and inform the affected customers.
