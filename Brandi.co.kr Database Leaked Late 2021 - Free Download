In late 2021, a major data breach occurred when the personal information of millions of people
was exposed on the internet. The breach was linked to brandi.co.kr, a popular online marketplace 
that allows individuals to buy and sell goods.

The brandi.co.kr leak is believed to have affected more than 30 million users. The personal
information exposed in the breach included names, phone numbers, email addresses details. 
The breach was first reported by a security researcher who discovered the database containing
the personal information of brandi.co.kr users.
