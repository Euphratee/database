In September 2019, the Music streaming platform Deezer suffered a data breach that impacted
257 million users. The attack led to the exposure of data including Full names, Email addresses,
Dates of birth, Genders, IP addresses, Locations and Usernames. The breach happened due to a
3rd party exposing the data via a publicly accessible backup.

I would like to warn users this leak is over 262.79GB uncompressed and 28.06GB compressed.

Compromised data: Full names, Email addresses, Dates of birth, Genders, Locations,
Usernames, IP Addresses
