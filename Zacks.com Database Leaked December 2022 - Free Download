In December 2022, the investment research company Zacks announced a data breach. The following month, reports
emerged of the incident impacting 820k customers. However, in June 2023, a corpus of data with almost 9M Zacks
customers appeared before being broadly circulated on a popular hacking forum. The most recent data was dated
May 2020 and included names, usernames, email and physical addresses, phone numbers and passwords stored as
unsalted SHA-256 hashes. On disclosure of the larger breach, Zacks advised that in addition to their original
report "the unauthorised third parties also gained access to encrypted passwords".
